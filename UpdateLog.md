# A small update; 1.3.51!

- Fixed the ufo bouncing really high up when using pads

- Made the ship feel more better in physics terms

- Made the new best image slightly smaller

- Made the percentage ALWAYS have exactly two decimal points. (Same as platformer time)

- Fixed a bug where the percentage's text size would flicker.

And.. That's all for this update! I know it might be buggy, but please report any of the bugs to me. Thanks!
