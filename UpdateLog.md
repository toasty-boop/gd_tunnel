# NOTES

I'm very glad to be able to update this beauty of a game to 0.4.0! It has been very fun to continuously do so, and it has helped my development skills.
I'm also glad to say this is starting to look like a finished product, although it still needs MANY blocks.

I've also recently found a group of people and helped me find some very useful values, so thanks to everyone who contributed!

Report any bugs to me, and I'll be happy to fix them! Happy dashing!!
