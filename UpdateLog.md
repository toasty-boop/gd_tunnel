# Big update; 1.3.5!

### Changed the physics to resemble the real GD ones! (USED IN-GAME VALUES)!!!

- This bugfix will make most online levels possible.
   
- Please note that this feature might make old editor levels impossible. Please update them!
   
- This bugfix is slightly buggy, and *will* be slightly modified in the future.

   
- If you experience any bugs, let me know.

### Added New Best effect!

### Started working on the icon selection!

### Fixed a bug where the "Shiny!" Achievement would be given to the player after accepting TOS!

### Added noclip detection!

- I'm thinking of adding noclip to the game, so i've added this detection (in this update) to serve as a base, and to also shoo away hackers.

### Demolished some bugs!! >:]

~

And.. That's all for this update! I know it might be buggy at release, but *please* be patient as I try to fix the bugs.

byee!!!
