# 1.3.3 is a really slippery update!.. In a good way!

-Added slopes!! (Buggy, but works)

-Fixed build mode's swipe feature for building tab!

It's not much, but it has some really good gameplay mechanics!

Due to the slopes being a bit too buggy, and me still not being able to figure out how to flip objects correctly..
I will not be implementing hexagon force or the later levels. Sorry :P
