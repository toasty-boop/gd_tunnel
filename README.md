# gd_tunnel
I have created this repo as a documentation for my [roblox game!](https://www.roblox.com/games/130195943844260)

The API mentioned only works if I have my servers running, which is rarely, and is actually just a free cloudflare thing, cuz i'm broke.

## USAGE

Request body is application/json

### /download-level
Downloads a level's raw data

Here's an example of how to use /download-level:
{
  "level_id": "string"
}

### /obtain-levels/{path}
Uses GD browser's level search API

This just redirects you to [API]/obtain-levels/{path} to gdbrowser.com/api/{path}
Search up its documentation for actual documentation!
